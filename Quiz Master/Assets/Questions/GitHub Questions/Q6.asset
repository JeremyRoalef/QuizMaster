  strAnswers:
  - Create a WebGL build of your game, place files in GitHub Repo, go to pages, deploy
    from main branch, and wait for site to automatically generate
  - Create a WebGL build of your game, place files in GitHub Repo, click on "Add
    file", and drag your html file into the repo.

    GitHub will take care of the remaining setup.
